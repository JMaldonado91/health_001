Does having fast food restaurants in your county increase chance of physical inactivity?

Resources:
1. Source where I gathered data for county statistics on leisure-time physical inactivity in 2014. Once you go to page, select U.S. report with county data bubble, and then click on the Risk Factors tab.
Select Leisure-Time Physical Inactivity	bubble and then click on Show Results. I used the top 20 counties with the highest percentage of leisure-time physical inactivity.

I created a graph in Matplotlib using database MySQL. The graph shows how the growth of fast-food restaurants in different counties have an impact on physical activity.
